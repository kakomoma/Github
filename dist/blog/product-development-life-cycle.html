        <p>Every product follows specific steps from being a simple idea to becoming a final product. This is known as the product development life cycle and consists of 5 stages: brainstorming, definition, design, testing, and launch.</p>
        <p>In this article, we explore the product development cycle and how UX designers work in each phase. Designers play their most significant role in the design stage but collaborate closely with other team members in the other phases to ensure the product meets the appropriate requirements.</p>
        <p>This life cycle doesn't estimate specific timelines; each stage can take different amounts of time depending on various factors. It's possible to revert to a previous stage if feedback requires it, and it's essential to follow the order of the stages to ensure maximum efficiency in the work.</p>

        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
        <img src="/assets/img/brainstorm.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>The first stage is brainstorming, where the team begins to conceptualize the product idea. The team needs to understand the problem that users want to solve. If these pain points or problems are not defined, it's time to identify them before starting.</p>
        <p>Multidisciplinary teams with diverse backgrounds and experiences are often more effective at defining new ideas because greater diversity and experience lead to a broader capacity for new solutions.</p>
        <p>This is also an appropriate time to examine existing products in the market and see what problems they are solving and how. It's crucial to ensure that the product you are launching has a place in the market and can provide extra value to users.</p>
        <p>In large companies, designers typically do not participate in this stage, but in small companies or startups, designers may be involved.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <img src="/assets/img/define.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>In this stage, designers, researchers, managers, and team leaders work together to define the product. The goal is to determine the specifications the product must have, answering questions like: for whom? What should the product do?</p>
        <p>During this stage, it's important to narrow down the focus of the idea. A product cannot solve all problems.</p>
        <p>Research is crucial at this point. It's necessary to identify the problems, and the team members alone are not enough to define them; we must ask real users. Researchers and their work will determine the problems that the design must address.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <img src="/assets/img/design.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>The third stage is design. This is where designers take the lead, developing the product ideas. Generally, the work begins with the generation of wireframes and later the creation of prototypes.</p>
        <p>At this point, designers must ensure they include the specifications required in the previous stage. The work should be done in a way that makes it very easy and intuitive for the user to understand the presented interface.</p>
        <p>A key point is that designers can define the tasks that users must perform and ensure that the design allows the completion of these tasks without issues.</p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <img src="/assets/img/test.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>Designs now move to the testing stage. Designers and engineers work together to develop prototypes and ensure that every specified detail becomes a reality. This stage must, therefore, include the development of the precise code.</p>
        <p>There are other options for testing products before they are coded by engineers. Adobe XD or Figma allows the creation of interactive prototypes that simplify their creation and do not require the work of engineers.</p>
        <p>During this stage, testing is usually divided into three different phases: internal tests, tests with stakeholders, and tests with real users.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Internal tests: allow the definition of technical aspects and some initial usability issues.</li>
          <li>Tests with stakeholders: to ensure that the product aligns with the company's specifications and objectives.</li>
          <li>With real users: it's the time to ensure that the product provides a good experience and works according to design principles (usable, equitable, pleasant, and useful).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In this stage, it's crucial to collect feedback and iterate on the product, making it possible to improve and address any problems that arise.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that the product development cycle is not a linear process, and the team can go back to a necessary stage whenever a reason for it is identified.</p>        

        <h3>Launch</h3>
        <img src="/assets/img/launch.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>Finally, the product is ready for its launch phase. In this stage, tasks may include making the product available on the market through the Play Store or developing a website to introduce it.</p>
        <p>It's time to start promoting the product, making posts on social media, and introducing it as comprehensively as possible.</p>
        <p>During the early stages of the launch, with real users testing the product, usability or design problems may arise that the team needs to address and resolve. Therefore, it wouldn't be uncommon to return to one of the previous stages and tackle the corresponding issue.</p>
