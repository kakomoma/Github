        <p>In this article, we will explore the main tasks and responsibilities of a UX designer in a typical day-to-day
          project. Additionally, you will understand the differences between generalists, specialists, and T-shaped
          designers.</p>

        <h3>Responsabilities</h3>
        <p><b>User Research:</b> It involves understanding people and how they interact with your product. Through
          research, you will learn about the background of your users, their demographic characteristics, motivations,
          problems, emotions, and goals. Research methods include surveys, observations, and interviews.</p>

        <p><b>Information architecture:</b> It entails deciding how your product is organized and structured. It could
          be thought of as the skeleton of the product and must be structured in a way that is easily recognizable and
          explorable by users.</p>

        <p><b>Wireframing:</b> It is a simple representation or design idea of a product. They are often done by hand or
          with programs like Adobe XD or Figma. They do not involve any complexity in their composition; for the most
          part, they consist of strokes and lines. They are used to represent ideas and make them visible.</p>

        <p><b>Prototyping:</b> It is a more accurate model or representation of the final product that has
          functionality. Prototypes can have a physical or digital format and can vary in complexity depending on the
          company and project. Often, the prototype is made to showcase a specific feature, such as a transition between
          pages. During the design process, it is very common to create different prototypes.</p>

        <p><b>Visual design:</b> It focuses on how the product or technology being designed looks. As a designer, you
          need to understand the fundamental principles of visual design to effectively communicate the relationship
          between functionality and the appearance it adopts for users.</p>

        <p><b>Effective communication:</b> This involves being available to team members through email, presentations,
          or design and communication programs. Design is a field where collaboration is crucial to achieving goals, so
          doing it effectively is very important. You need to be a good listener, have a high capacity to receive and
          handle criticism, and be able to express ideas clearly and simply.</p>

        <h3>Specialists and generalists</h3>
        <p>As you progress in the design career, you can choose between different fields of specialization or
          responsibilities within companies.</p>

        <p><b>Specialists:</b> They delve into a specific type of design, such as interaction, visual, or animations,
          and become experts in that field. This type of designer is more common in large companies. Some of their
          advantages include:
        <ol>
          <li>Focus on a type of design they enjoy more than others.</li>
          <li>Have greater knowledge in that field, becoming experts.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>Generalists:</b> They have a wide range of responsibilities. Most designers work under this type, and it
          is very common in companies with fewer designers available. They have some advantages such as:
        <ol>
          <li>They can expand their skills among different specializations.</li>
          <li>They can test themselves by working in different areas and thus find their passion.</li>
          <li>They maintain a fresh passion for what they do, as they perform different tasks instead of dedicating
            themselves to a single specific thing.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>T-shaped:</b> It is a specialist who also acquires other skills. An example could be a designer
          specializing in visual design but also having knowledge in code and graphic animation.

        <p><b>In conclusion, </b>as a designer, there are multiple paths you can take. After landing your first job and
          gaining experience, you can evaluate which options you like the most and in which fields you want to
          specialize.</p>
