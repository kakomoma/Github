            possible.</p>
          <p>They answer questions like: What visual style should the icons have to align with the brand design? What

          <p>Virtual reality and augmented reality are fields where designers are also specializing. They focus on
            creating immersive experiences without the limitations of the physical world.</p>
          <p>Virtual reality involves users' vision being controlled by a wearable headset, blocking out their external
            space and immersing them in a virtual world. It gives the user the feeling of being in an imaginary place.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, augmented reality uses physical space to add virtual elements in an overlay, allowing
            both
            worlds to be available simultaneously.</p>
          <p>For example, you could be in your kitchen, and through augmented reality, images like a new stool or a
            piece
            of art could be added and appear around you.</p>
          <p>They answer questions like: How can we create experiences that make the most of space and provide a 3D
            sensation?</p>
