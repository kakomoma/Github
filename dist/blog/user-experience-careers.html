        <p>If your goal is to land a job as a UX designer, it's a good idea to understand important aspects of the industry. It's a field that is constantly evolving, and in recent years, it has become a highly sought-after position in the Tech sector.</p>
        <p>"UX designer" is the commonly used term for the position, although within this role, there are different figures and specific positions that cover various aspects of the product design process.</p>
        <p>In this article, you will learn about these different positions and their responsibilities within a company.</p>

        <h3>Interaction designer</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/interaction-designer.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>They focus on the user experience and product functions. Their efforts revolve around understanding the user flow, or the path users take to complete different tasks in a mobile application or website.</p>
        <p>They ask questions like: What happens if the user presses this button? How are different design elements distributed within the website?</p>

        <h3>Visual designer</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/visual-designer.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>They concentrate on how the product looks. They are responsible for logos, illustrations, icons, color, typography, sizes, and the positioning of different elements.</p>
        <p>They handle the design of each page and ensure that all elements are arranged in the most apparent way possible.</p>
        <p>They answer questions like: What visual style should the icons have to align with the brand design? What color and font should this button have?</p>

        <h3>Motion designer</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/motion-designer.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>They think about how users feel when navigating the product and how to create smooth transitions between different pages. They are also in charge of creating animations and visual effects that bring ideas to life.</p>
        <p>They answer questions like: How should the transition between these pages be? How should we show the connection between these elements?</p>
        <p>They focus on movement and action rather than traditional static designs.</p>

        <h3>VR/AR Designer</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/vr-designer.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>Virtual reality and augmented reality are fields where designers are also specializing. They focus on creating immersive experiences without the limitations of the physical world.</p>
        <p>Virtual reality involves users' vision being controlled by a wearable headset, blocking out their external space and immersing them in a virtual world. It gives the user the feeling of being in an imaginary place.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, augmented reality uses physical space to add virtual elements in an overlay, allowing both worlds to be available simultaneously.</p>
        <p>For example, you could be in your kitchen, and through augmented reality, images like a new stool or a piece of art could be added and appear around you.</p>
        <p>They answer questions like: How can we create experiences that make the most of space and provide a 3D sensation?</p>
        <p>They must pay special attention to light and sound to make the experience as real as possible.</p>

        <h3>UX Researcher</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/ux-researcher.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>They are responsible for conducting studies and interviews examining how users use a particular product.</p>
        <p>They identify pain points users experience during product use and try to answer how products can solve those problems.</p>
        <p>They also study usability in real products, asking users to complete different tasks in an application or website.</p>
        <p>They answer questions like: What problems are users facing? Is the design of this product easy to use?</p>
        <p>The goal of researchers is to understand how a product can offer a solution to a real problem that users are facing.</p>  
        
        <h3>UX Writer</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/ux-writer.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>They think about how to convey the idea in the best way and what language to use for it. They also help define the brand image and the personality it should have. Their work usually includes writing labels for buttons that determine the tone of language used within the product.</p>
        <p>They focus on answering questions like: What words should I use to communicate this idea in the best possible way? Should the tone of this product be friendly or technical?</p>

        <h3>UX Program manager</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/ux-program-manager.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>They are responsible for maintaining clear and effective communication so that the creation process is appropriate from start to finish.</p>
        <p>This task includes setting goals, writing project plans, and ensuring that the team has the necessary resources.</p>
        <p>They answer questions like: What are the project's objectives? How can we create and improve processes for the team?</p>
        <p>They work with all departments, ensuring that project objectives are met and helping to solve any problems that may arise.</p>

        <h3>UX Engineer</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/ux-engineer.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>They translate designs into functional experiences. They help design teams figure out how to address technical issues that may arise during the creation or development process.</p>
        <p>They answer questions like: How can we implement this interaction? How can we develop this design to match the original design?</p>
        <p>They are responsible for synthesizing design and development, making concepts come to life.</p>

        <h3>Conversation Designer</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/conversation-designer.png" alt="Interaction designer" width="300" height="300">
        <p>Conversational interfaces include all situations and products in which users can have a conversation with a digital product, such as navigation systems or chatbots.</p>
        <p>They are responsible for incorporating naturalness and patterns of human behavior into interactions between products and users.</p>
        <p>They answer questions like: What would be the ideal language depending on the type of user and the task they need to perform? Should the virtual assistant's personality convey a specific emotion?</p>
